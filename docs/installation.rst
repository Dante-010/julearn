Installing JuLearn
==================


Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Julearn requires the following packages:

* `Python`_ >= 3.6
* `scikit-learn`_
* `pandas`_

Depending on the installation method, this packages might be installed
automatically.

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^
There are different ways to install julearn:

* Install the :ref:`install_latest_release`. This is the most suitable approach
for most end users.
* Install the :ref:`install_latest_development`. This version will have the
latest features. However, it is still under development and not yet officialy
released. Some features might still change before the next stable release.
* Install from :ref:`install_development_git`. This is mostly suitable for
developers that want to have the latest version and yet edit the code.


Either way, we strongly recommend using virtual environments:

* `venv`_
* `conda env`_
